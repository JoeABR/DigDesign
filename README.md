# DigtalDesign
![DigtalDesign](chip.png)
a simple repository about programming and simulating digital design circuits in Verilog, VHDL and System Verilog Hardware language.   
Plus custome design circuits.
## Tools
Used Tools will be kept open source as possible.
- ### GHDL

>For VHDL Compilation and testing  
>Could Also be used for synthesis **still under test**  
>you can see the vendors libraries supported here 
[**Supported Vendors Libraries**](https://ghdl.github.io/ghdl/getting.html#supported-vendors-libraries)   
>you can install by either building from source (**Windows**) or using a package managers (**Linux/Mac**) *apt*, *pacman* and so on...   
>**For Example** here is how to install easily from your shell for *ubuntu* or *depian* based distros.   
```shell
sudo apt-get update  
sudo apt-get install ghdl
```
